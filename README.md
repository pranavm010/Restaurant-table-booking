# Restaurant-table-booking
This project was developed in the python and MongoDb to provide user the service for reserving a table and preordering the food in hotel to reduce the crowd in hotel and manage time for people. It gives user options to select date, time and table number according to their convenience. Using MongoDb as database tool we managed all the data.
